# Single Owner Phone

These are the operations related to the Single Owner Phone for the [Mop Bridge]() project.

As the [Idemia System]() restricts the issue of a single [OwnerKey]() per user phone and vehicle,
when the user is accessing his account in a second phone, he can choose to request a new owner key 
in the new phone or to request a [LUK key]().
